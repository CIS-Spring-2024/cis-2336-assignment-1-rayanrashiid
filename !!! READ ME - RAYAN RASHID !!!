Dear Professor and TAs,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding an issue I've encountered while attempting to submit my project. Despite several attempts,
I've encountered difficulties with organizing the files within their respective CSS, HTML, and IMG folders. Specifically, while I've successfully managed to place
files into the CSS folder and reference them in the HTML using relative paths (e.g., "IMG/burger.jpg"), the same approach doesn't seem to work when organizing
files within the HTML folder. I've searched extensively for a solution and even reached out to the TA for guidance, but unfortunately, I haven't received a
response yet. I wanted to bring this to your attention and inquire if there's any alternative method I could employ to ensure proper submission.

I'm committed to completing the project to the best of my ability and would greatly appreciate any assistance you could provide in resolving this issue.
Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Rayan Rashid
